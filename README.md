# Japanese-Parser
Japanese Translator Project

Uses deterministic finite automata to parse out japanese words.
This program, parses Japanese words to see if they follow Japanese grammar rules
I've uploaded a couple versions of this program, You can see my work "oldscanner.cpp" and our completed work "group6project.cpp"
Run group6project.cpp with Japanese.txt when the program asks you which text file you want to parse.
